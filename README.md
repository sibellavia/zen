Zen
</p>


# Overview

Zen is yet another Pomodoro app for macOS. It was born from a personal project, where I wanted a personal and minimal timer, without too many features and without too many customizations. In fact, the UI is very simple and is mostly controllable from the macOS menu.

# How to install
You can either compile Zen from source manually or download the latest stable artifact [here](https://github.com/simoneb1x/zen).
